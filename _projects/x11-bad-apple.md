<h1 style="color: #cc0000">Bad Apple!! (X11)</h1>  

![Demo](https://github.com/Ti1mmy/X11-Bad-Apple/raw/main/demo.gif)
<p class="small">Demo run on local linux server with 30ms frame-to-frame delay. (if running on a remote server, you may want to remove this delay)</p>

My attempt at playing the famous "Bad Apple!!" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkgK8eUdpAo) on [anything but a video player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBeI30ccb6g). Arguably this project is a video player but it has none of the features and does not even read the video file from disk. Instead it is pre-compiled into the program.

Yeah I should really go back to this and thank my first year self for being dumb.
