<h1 style="color: #cc0000">Battlesnake Game AI</h1>  

[Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) AI written in Python. We used the Minimax algorithm and a clever heuristic algorithm which ended up getting us the win in the company's internal intern hackathon. 

Not an ad, but we used [Railway](https://railway.app/) and a custom GitHub Actions workflow to deploy our bot, super great experience.

We also got a trophy! (Shoutout to Sunny you're the goat)
